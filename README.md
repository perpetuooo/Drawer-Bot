> Python made bot that, upon receiving a keyword, downloads an equivalent image and draws it simulating the user's cursor.

## Requirements
Some libraries are necessary if you want to run the source code instead of downloading the compiled version:
```

```

```
git clone https://github.com/perpetuooo/Drawer-Bot.git
```
## Usage
1. Open the executable or run the *main.py* file;
2. Select the space in which the drawing will be made (after selecting, **DO NOT** change the window placement);
3. Search a word for your image to be searched, downloaded and drawn;

## To-do
